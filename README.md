this repository was built as part of my talk at GrrCon'24, titled "Monsters Under Your Bed - Mapping the Dark Web with Python". This code is completely AI generated and doesn't work exactly as intended, but I am sharing it to show what you can do with a few detailed prompts and some patience.
> If you are looking to use this in production, I strongly encourage you to update it to better fit your expectations.
